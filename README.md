Path of Exile, an online Action RPG. It's endgame content is focused around maps, which are items that can be activated to generate a
level. The Atlas of Worlds expansion introduced the atlas, which connects maps in a way that allows players to navigate through them 
with the goal of reaching the center, which is where the hardest maps are located.

The Atlas of Worlds Map is a tool made to improve the player's experience with the atlas. It lets users track their progress in the 
atlas by marking completed maps, search for the location of maps, see additional information about them and more.
